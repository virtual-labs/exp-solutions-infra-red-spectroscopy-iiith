      "question": "3. Which of the following chemical changes will IR spectroscopy be able to capture?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Rotation of a CO<sub>2</sub> molecule.",
        "b": "Cleavage of C-O bond in CO<sub>2</sub>.",

        "d": "Excitation of CO<sub>2</sub> to a higher electronic state."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Rotation of any molecule will lead to transitions among its rotational states, leading to Microwave spectroscopy.",
        "b": "C-O bond cleavage occurs due to the vibration of this bond and hence this will include transitions among the vibrational energy levels,leading to IR spectroscopy.",
        "c": "Striking of CO<sub>2</sub> gas to the walls of the container increases the energy of the molecules but does not affect its internal vibrations, and hence cannot be detected by IR spectroscopy.",
        "d": "Transitions among electronic energy levels can be captured by UV-Visible spectroscopy. "

      "question": "4. Which of the following statements is true concerning infrared (IR) spectroscopy?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "IR spectroscopy is used to determine the frequency of vibrations between atoms",
        "b": "The fingerprint region is most easily used to determine the functional groups in the molecule",
        "c": "IR spectroscopy is used to determine the shape of the carbon backbone",
        "d": "IR spectroscopy can be used to easily determine molecular mass"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "IR spectroscopy is most commonly used to determine the functional groups found in the molecule being observed. This is done by observing the vibration frequencies between atoms in the molecule.",
        "b": "IR does not easily reveal the size or shape of the molecule's carbon skeleton.",
        "c": "Although the fingerprint region is unique for every molecule, it is very difficult to read when attempting to determine the molecule's functional groups.",
        "d": "IR spectroscopy cannot be used to determine molecular mass but can be used to determine the change in molecular mass due to change of an atom with its isotope."
