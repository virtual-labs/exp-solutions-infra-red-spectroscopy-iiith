Infrared spectroscopy or IR spectroscopy is the technique that involves the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. IR region lies between the visible and microwave regions and works mostly based on absorption spectroscopy. The infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is usually divided into three regions; near or higher energy IR (14000 - 4000 cm<sup>-1</sup>), mid-IR (4000 - 400 cm<sup>-1</sup> ), and far or low energy infrared (400 - 10 cm<sup>-1</sup>). The mid-infrared gives the fundamental vibrations and associated rotational-vibrational structure of the substance under study. Infrared spectroscopy is the absorption of infrared radiation by the molecules and is used to elucidate the structure of the molecule by identifying its functional groups. One of the common laboratory instruments that use this technique is a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer.
