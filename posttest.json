      "question": "1. In IR spectroscopy, the vibration between atoms is caused by which of the following?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The overall molecular weight of the molecule",
        "b": "Dipole moments between atoms",
        "c": "The movement of electrons to higher energy levels",
        "d": "The number of protons in a nucleus"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The atomic weight of the atoms involved in the vibration between atoms affects the vibration, but the molecular weight does not cause the vibration between atoms.",
        "b": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopy takes advantage of the electrical difference between atoms in a polar bond. These dipole moments, when exposed to infrared radiation, stretch and contract in what appears to be a vibrating motion between the atoms.",
        "c": "Any transition among electronic energy levels would be captured by the Electronic or UV-Visible spectroscopy.",
        "d": "Any change in the number of protons will affect the vibration energy levels due to change in its mass, but it is not the primary cause of the vibration between atoms."

        "b": "Carbonyl groups have strong, sharp peaks from 1700cm<sup>-1</sup> to 1750cm<sup>-1</sup>, depending on the type of carbonyl group. For instance, an ester (-RCO2R'-) has an absorbance at about 1750cm<sup>-1</sup>",
